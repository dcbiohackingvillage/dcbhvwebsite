                    <span class="timeslot"><i>Abstract:</i></span><br>
                    As medical devices increasingly embrace connected technologies, there's a growing opportunity for malicious actors to interfere with devices for profit or to cause harm. The good news is that many security researchers are working to investigate the security of medical devices. However, for this effort to have a positive impact, researchers and vendors must work together to understand the true risk, address the issues, and educate physicians and patients.
                    In many cases, the risk may be low and should not outweigh the benefits of the device; however, mismanaged disclosures can cause panic and confusion. In other cases, researchers may struggle to engage vendors on the issue and patients may never hear of it, or they do, but no mitigation is offered. With the stakes so much higher in the healthcare arena, it's essential that we learn lessons from medical device disclosures that have gone well, and those that have not. This talk will investigate a number of public disclosures, and provide actionable guidance on how to disclose security concerns for the best possible outcomes.

                    As medical and recreational devices shift from outside to inside the body, challenges arise not only for builders and breakers of these devices, but also for regulators. This panel will introduce the progress of the Internet of Things into the "Internet of Bodies" and explain how existing legal and policy frameworks of
                    consumer protection and security fit with this next generation of body-attached and body-embedded devices (and how they don't).

                    Editing genes is getting easier as knowledge of various genomes and technology  advance. Malicious actors creating novel or custom infectious agents are a growing concern. This presentation explores use of Cyber Kill Chain methodology
                    to detect and disrupt potential bioterrorist activities. Each link in the chain is defined and examined to identify potential attack indicators and countermeasures, discussing notable bottlenecks in each step. The goal is to
                    apply existing information security knowledge and paradigms to counter the would-be bioterrorist. This talk will include brief discussions of current gene editing methods (CRISPR-CAS9, ZINCFINGER) for the lay person. Familiarity with the Cyber Kill Chain would be useful.

                    As medical and recreational devices shift from outside to inside the body, challenges arise not only for builders and breakers of these devices, but also for regulators. This panel will introduce the progress of the Internet of Things into the "Internet of Bodies" and explain how existing legal and policy frameworks of
                    consumer protection and security fit with this next generation of body-attached and body-embedded devices (and how they don't).

                    This is a journey into fitness.  My fitness and more importantly your fitness.  Or rather the information that I've been collecting every day at the gym while getting ready for bikini season.  This a look at my journey to become the sexy stud muffin you see before you (google image search "sexy stud muffin" for reference) and my quest to do bad things through various means, up to and including compromising cardio equipment, fitness apps, and changing delivery addresses for fitness equipment to my house instead of your gym. No zero days and nothing overly technical provided here, but the intended takeaway is awareness of who is collecting your PHI and from where. Just like on Maury, the results will shock and amaze.  Or maybe you'll just get a good laugh at my journey to lose 100 pounds.

                    "Natural selection can produce marvelous functional systems, but constraints in the evolutionary process can be exploited. By leveraging humanity’s relative advantage in design foresight, we may be able to create synthetic organisms that can out-compete their natural counterparts.
                    In this talk, I will explore the design limitations of evolved organisms that leave ecosystems permanently vulnerable to attack. In order to protect the natural world and human health, I will advocate we adopt the “biosecurity mindset” and improve our ecological security posture."

                    Recent advances in remote sensing, drones, distributed computing, bigdata, and environmental DNA offer an unprecedented opportunity to push epidemiology beyond its traditional, two-dimensional (i.e. map-based) approach and harness the full availability and power of three-dimensional data and novel investigation methods to explore such data. This talk will present an extremely technology-specific vision for achieving this.
                    Examples of the potential usefulness of this approach will be demonstrated with respect to three scenarios:  (1) avian flu, (2) asthma, and post-flooding fecal contamination. The current state of the art of the component technologies will be presented as well as the remaining challenges for their seamless integration.

                    "Healthcare is enamored with data. We have more data than we know what to do with (e.g., constant flows of data from wearables, new and cheaper ways to sequence genomes, digital phenotypes expressed through social media interactions) and there is a rush to deploy this data in clinical research and care. As we combine this “data”, we start to build a digital replica of each human. Our healthcare data carries new weight, new responsibilities. The rise in data means that we are gaining a greater body of knowledge as we assemble a digital representation of a person. We are getting closer to full understanding of someone’s biology, brain structure, how and why they think and do what they do. We are entering into a world where precision medicine and “N of 1” studies is (finally) becoming possible. On the flipside, we are also entering into a period of unprecedented monitoring and surveillance. As a society, we have standards for how we handle human blood, tissue and other human specimens. It’s now time for us to talk more about how we are to handle our digital specimens. In the talk, we’ll discuss the proliferation of our biometric and psychographic data, use cases, and the new ethical and custodial responsibilities that arise for individuals, regulators and companies."

                    To quote Bob Marley “If you know your history, then you would know where you coming from”. This talk is a retrospective on the last ten years or so of medical device security research, intended to bring hackers interested in this discipline up to speed on what has been accomplished to date, how it was done, why it matters and where we stand today.
                    This talk will timeline all the major events in medical device security research, describing in technical detail what was accomplished and how. This should make evident some of the systemic vulnerability classes present in medical devices and hopefully give the medical device security researchers of tomorrow a good idea of where to start looking.
                    It will also cover some of the basic tools and techniques needed to get started in this discipline, as well as some of the practicalities involved in obtaining devices, firmware and information on various classes of medical devices and how differences in attack surface may influence your choice of devices to target for research.

                    This talk originally started as a look at the intersection of personal anonymity and personal genetic sequencing. The short version: “Genetic Privacy” is a very tough thing to accomplish; lack of such privacy has potentially “bad” consequences. But there was some hope IF you did everything right. Then we all discovered that the prospects for genetic privacy are even lower than we imagined. You may have heard that the suspected Golden State Killer was found and arrested after decades of terror. The suspect didn’t slip up, other than having relatives who wanted to know more about their own genes. No one is accusing you of murder (I hope), but almost everyone has some aspect of their genetics that they don’t want others to know. So now, not only do you have to get everything right the first time to guard your genetic privacy – you have to hope all your relatives get the genetic privacy stuff right the first time…and every time they get tested. And for those of you who say, “But wait! The laws against genetic discrimination will save us!” consider that various laws also ban other forms of discrimination. How’s that working out these days?

Unless we slow down a little, do the analysis, design and testing, we’re going off the edge of the cliff at full speed.The session is going to give some background on the evolutionary cycles that have happened in the past, and then examine the human SDLC for the last 12,000 years or so…then we’ll draw some comparisons to how we’re approaching the march of technology that we’re seeing today with the idea that we’ll match up what’s happening TO us is also a product of what we’re doing to ourselves etc.…Mother Nature’s not got a habit of rapid prototyping, so why do we do that to ourselves, why are we putting 20+ Billion devices into circulation with problems etc.

                    Two years ago, the Four Thieves Vinegar Collective became public at HOPE XI after almost a decade of working underground, and debuted the first generation of the Apothecary Microlab, the open-source automated chemical reactor designed to synthesize the active ingredients of pharmaceutical drugs. We synthesized Daraprim onstage, and called Martin Shkreli's cell phone from stage. It was a good time. Since then, the reactor has developed, and we have worked on more complicated syntheses, and hacking medical hardware. Most notably, we released plans for a DIY version of the EpiPen anyone can make for $30US. Come see the new releases we have planned and the new beta unit. Learn how to make medicine from poison, how to use the shrouding of information about medicine to make custom-tailored treatment programs for rare diseases, and how to use public data to find new, more efficient synthesis pathways for drugs. Hack your health. We can torrent medicine. File sharing saves lives.

                    "As prenatal testing and ultrasound technology have greatly improved, so has our ability to diagnose birth defects and genetic diseases earlier and earlier in pregnancy. Until recently, our only available options were to offer pregnancy termination or wait to see if the baby survived long enough to be treated after birth. But what if we had the capability to intervene before those genetic mutations had a chance to cause their harmful effects, sparing parents from the agony of uncertain pregnancy outcomes and saving children from debilitating diseases? In last year’s “Designer Babies: Hacking Human Embryos” we discussed pre-implantation genetic testing and embryo modification as a means to identify and treat heritable diseases, by correcting harmful gene mutations before a pregnancy even begins. Since then, exciting new research has shown that even after a pregnancy is under way, opportunities still exist for hacking the biological machinery of the fetus to alter its developmental course.This talk will review new and rapidly evolving strategies to treat genetic disease in utero – while the baby is still in the womb - by hijacking the embryologic mechanisms responsible for fetal growth and development.
                    Examples include:<br>
                        - injection of a critical protein into the amniotic fluid surrounding babies with X-linked hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia, a genetic condition causing a lack of sweat glands and the life-threatening inability to regulate temperature<br>
                        - transfusion of mesenchymal stem cells into the fetal umbilical cord to treat osteogenesis imperfecta or “brittle bone disease”<br>
                        - in utero blood and bone marrow transplant to treat the fatal hemoglobin disorder alpha-thalessemia major<br>
                        - correcting deformities such as cleft lip and palate by triggering cell signaling pathways ""knocked out"" by genetic mutation "

That it is a neuro wheelchair control software developed to help people with different physical abilities who have reduced mobility and use wheelchairs, by capturing data provided by neuro sensors or other sources of information, the software converts them into an order of movement to one or several engines, allowing the movement of a wheelchair. “Over Mind” will allow you to control any adapted electric wheelchair. You can also control an exoskeleton or other mechanism that facilitates the mobility of people. We have managed to control a high-tech robot using our Over Mind software and using a sensor provided by Neurosky

                        The 1% of the world population cannot move by itself, for various reasons such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), accidents and others, 50,000,000 people.
                        Over Mind is a a low-cost technology/system developed in Chile, designed to give mobility to 1% of the world population, increasing its available physical capacities allowing people with zero or reduced mobility to MOVE and carry out activities on their own, granting freedom and autonomy.
                        The year 2016 Over Mind participated in the contest ""An idea to change history"", organized by History Channel together with 5,800 projects and it was the only Chilean project that finished among the four finalists."

                            The advancement of technology means more data are being collected from a wider range of sources. Of particular concern is data collected using a Brain Computer Interface (BCI): a device that records neural signals and allows them to control objects external to the body. Applications for this
                            technology range from therapeutic (e.g. controlling a prosthetic arm) to entertainment (e.g. playing a video game). These cases provide malicious entities the ability to intercept, manipulate, or hack neural signals and the devices they control: it is the plot of Batman Forever (1995) come to life.

                                While important changes may be afoot in the US regulatory environment for medical devices, which should hopefully allow more people to make informed decisions regarding patient safety, many CISOs, security engineers, and network admins have to live day to day in the world we have, not the world we wish for.  There have been multiple presentations in the last few years about the details of medical device security that have rightly put the onus on manufacturers to provide long term fixes.  However, we wonder if there are ways to create a more defensible and hardened hospital room until the notoriously slow regulatory process gains traction.We’ve done deep dives into specific medical devices and we’ve done pentests in several hospital systems.  In our experience, we have noticed broad classes of common vulnerabilities across bedside equipment that transcend any one device or class of device.  Input validation errors, buggy network stacks, and low-bandwidth links can be found in systems that monitor vitals, administer medications, or in components that glue disparate systems together.  A long awaited patch may fix one vulnerability only for the hospital to bring in a different device for clinical or financial reasons, and wash-rinse-repeat.  It’s not enough for one or two manufacturers to step up the security game if they are feeding data into other unreliable systems, and it will be a while before everyone is at the same level. We are dedicated red teamers, and we may feel the pain of those in the blue team trying to do the right thing, but we don’t know what it’s like to live in your shoes.  In this talk, we will explain, in broad terms, vulnerabilities that we have seen and how we recommend remediating them.  But we don’t want you to leave this session feeling that we are talking down to the defenders.  We want you to have a seat at the table and share how you handle the unknown in your environment.

                    Biological viruses have existed and evolved for millions of years, maliciously exploiting host cells for survival. How have they done this, and what can we learn from it?
                    Extremely advanced mechanisms for privilege escalation, persistence, and defence evasion have been used by biological viruses long before malware was first written.
                    This talk will provide an understanding of what mechanisms are used by biological viruses to exploit immune defences, persist, and survive in the arms race with the immune system.
                    Surprising differences between malware and virus actions will be shown, and some mechanisms which are used by viruses, but have not been adopted, or even attempted by malware, will be revealed.
                    No biological background is needed, only an open mind.

                    Thanks to the use of DNA in criminal investigations, hundreds of innocent people have been exonerated from crimes they did not commit.  DNA has also been used to used to arrest suspects in cold cases!  In my presentation I will give a primer on the techniques used for DNA profiling and the statistics for false positives.  The bulk of my presentation will be looking into the vulnerabilities of
                    current DNA profiling methods and how a malicious actor could actually reconstruct enough genotypic information of any innocent person from just a picture of their face.  This is based on recently published Nature Genetics research and extends the methods to suggest that it would only take ~50 million face:genotype samples to have a sufficient genotypic mapping that would allow someone to recreate your 23andMe profile (602,000 SNPs) from a selfie.

                    As an IT professional and biohacker Amanda Plimpton is delighted by the surge of citizen scientists who are driven to investigate, experiment and seek answers. She is interested in how the biohacking/body augmenting community can help its growing pool of talented, passionate individuals contribute to their fields from the commercial, academic or non-profit sectors. As Chief Operating Officer at Livestock Labs she is helping build a company that showcases one way biohackers can enter commercial spaces. Hoping to bring back lessons learned, she wants to keep helping grow a community that supports each other and promotes successes.

                    Let’s talk biohacking, technology and business. We are a community that is innovating and creating — mostly in non-profit and academic spaces. As we have grown so have the business opportunities, sometimes in unexpected places. My company, Livestock Labs, is bringing its biometric implant to market — in cows first. Started by grinders, the company is proving what we all know — that when we get funding and dedicated time our projects take off. This session tries to shed some light on learning to business as a biohacker and encourages other body augmenters and diyBio folks to take the leap and see what amazing things they can accomplish.

                    Veronica or Vee is a Partner at DFIRLABS. She is a forensicator, avid researcher and quite literally the superglue that holds DFIRLABS together. She was previously in charge of the Free State Cyber Forensic Laboratory of the Special Investigating Unit. After deciding that this title on its own wasn’t already too much of a mouthful, she departed the SIU in order to add Malware (Reverse) Engineer, Photographer, Seamstress, Super Mom and Sleep-deprived MSc Chaser to her list. She PWN’s to own her own medical device which aids her broken heart beats, into a different rhythm, sometimes this beat is much like that of drums beating. She is passionate about medical device security and does not believe in security through obscurity. In between attending Metallica concerts and being converted into a cyborg (no really, ask her about her metal bits sometime), she completed a Diploma in Criminal Justice and Forensic Investigation from the University of Johannesburg. Deciding to brave foreign climes and curiosities, she went on to receive training in Europe on digital forensics and cyber crime investigation from the United States Department of Homeland Security. She is an Associate Member of a number of professional bodies, including the Institute of Information Technology of Professionals of South Africa, the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, and the International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists. Veronica has contributed to several publications, including the ISC2 CCFP : Certified Computer Forensic Practitioner. She is currently juggling a Master’s thesis on ransomware, several digital forensics cases, getting a quality forensics training company off the ground, and reverse engineering ransomware whilst also keeping her two year old from walking into things. You can contact her by lighting up the night sky with the P10z0n_P1x13  beacon mounted on the top of the Twitter police department, or alternatively by email.

                    The increase of pace in the technology field has left the race for manufacturers to increase the security in medical devices. There is the theoretically possibility that your heart can be pwned. Pacemakers have become part of the internet of things. We are putting our hearts on display. This is my journey from regular hacker to gen-one cyborg to pwning my own heart that I can own the vulnerabilities to fix it. We forget that these are devices connected to flesh and blood, a person who depends on this device to have just one more heart beat. This is a journey into the inner sanctum of living with a vulnerable device in a time where technology progression has left behind security. We can no longer have security by obscurity when it comes to devices which cyborg’s like me depend on.We should not be in the business of sacrificing security for convenience or power. As a patient, I would rather sleep knowing my device has been hardened and have the inconvenience of replacing it more regularly than the converse. I feel that we, as the security community, should be addressing and assisting medical manufacturers with the security vulnerabilities in the devices that literally keep people alive. There should be more effort placed on addressing the security vulnerabilities. The simple fact is we are not dealing with just ones and zeroes. This is, for some, a life or death situation.

  Would you like to cure the most common infectious disease in humans? Want to see it done? Come to the BioHacking Village at 2:30 on saturday, and watch it happen live. If you like what you see, come back and participate in the workshop, where you can make your own cure, and make as many copies as you want.
  <br>
  We are finding out that many diseases are tied to the balance of our microbiomes. We have ecosystems in our gut, our colon, our skin, our mouth, our eyes, our ears, and more. Some of the microbes we have a working relationship with, and others are pathogenic. Yet we are forced to suffer them all equally.
  <br>
  With a bit of genetic engineering, we can build a friendly version of a pathogen, make it stronger, and send it in to replace the pathogenic version. But the true magic, is that a medicine made of a living material is self-replicating, so you can make copies for everyone you know, and they can make copies for everyone they know.
  <br>
  This weekend may mark the beginning of the end of a disease. Want to be able to say you were there when it all began? Swing on by.

                    The Biohacking Village, in collaboration with I Am The Cavalry, is building a Medical Device Lab at DEF CON to improve trust and trustworthiness of the public health system. The Lab is a high-trust, high-collaboration environment where security researchers can learn and build their skills alongside patients, medical device makers, hospitals, the FDA, and others.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <p class="black_text bold">We welcome participants who will act in good faith, in the best interest of patients, when researching, disclosing, and addressing security issues.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p class="black_text bold">Medical Device Makers Participate</p>
                      As part of their product security programs and their proactive initiatives to test their products and enhance the cybersecurity of their medical technologies, select medical device makers [to be revealed when the village opens] have provided devices for use in the Biohacking Village. These manufacturers are inviting security researchers to learn and to test their products in dedicated spaces set aside for them. Their staff will answer questions, educate researchers, and triage any potential security issues. Researchers who perform testing should expect to follow the manufacturers’ published coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy and report any potential issues found so they can be addressed.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <p class="black_text bold">Bring Your Own Medical Device</p>
                      Security researchers and others are also bringing devices, and there should be enough to go around. Some of these will require special tools and knowledge, so bring software defined radios, device manuals, and whatever else you think might help you research them. We expect researchers who perform testing on any devices in the lab will follow the manufacturers’ coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy and report issues found, where possible.

                      A team of security researchers from the Mayo Clinic created a medical device <a class="purple_text" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security" target="_blank">Capture The Flag</a> (CTF) to teach device hacking skills. Their game simulates a vulnerable infusion pump and PACS system, with several flags at different points that will keep researchers entertained as they learn. More details, such as time commitment, skills, and others, will be revealed in the Biohacking Village itself.

                      <p class="black_text bold">Office Hours</p>
                      We will have several individuals holding “office hours,” from the security research community, device makers, FDA, and others. Want to know what the FDA is doing to improve security of medical devices? How does a doctor prioritize security over other considerations when treating patients with devices? What tradeoffs do product security teams consider when getting safe and effective devices in the hands of patients? How do successful security researchers start looking at medical devices? These questions, and more, will be fair game when some of the people in those roles every day hold “office hours” in the Lab.

                      <p class="black_text bold">Quack Devices</p>
                      A member of the DEF CON community will showcase his “quack” medical devices from the 1800s-1930s. These devices are crazy, creepy throwbacks from the Victorian era should make us all appreciate how far healthcare has come, in terms of safety, effectiveness, and trustworthiness!

                      We’re building out other resources that will be available for researchers to get started testing medical devices. We’ll have some tools, information, education, and training available to help you get started. If you have any to add, hit us up on Twitter or in the lab.

The BHV celebrates global health ingenuity arising from maker communities from the dynamic perspective of emerging biology, technology, and human-enhancement. In one year, we have more than doubled our talks and tripled the number of attendees. The BioHacking Village has grown from a small half village of 11 talks and demos to a full village with 28 non-stop talks and demonstrations with standing room only and entrance lines that exceeded capacity.<br>
</br>
Whether your interest lies in security, technology, engineering, science, humanities, design, or fabrication, donors to the BioHacking Village can be assured they are reaching an audience of unapologetically enthusiastic innovators.<br>
