                    Biosecurity and information security share a common vocabulary and threat environment due to the shared infection paradigm. Since both biosecurity and information security exist in an environment with pervasive and continuously evolving threats, both fields utilize similar methods to reduce risk: controlled access to facilities (isolation), maintenance of 'safe' environment (sanitation), user training (education), and ongoing checks for hazards (monitoring). The main differences between the two are ease of attack (virtual vs. physical) and costs/penalties for failure.</p><hr class="greenhr">

                    A Hacker needs intimate and thorough understanding of the internal workings of a system to successfully and elegantly manipulate that system; along with the chutzpah to do so. ;)</br></br>
                    Living tissue is active matter; it dissipates free energy while maintaining itself in a viable state. This requires a Control system that reduces the degrees of freedom of the system to only those desired.</br></br>
                    All disorders are disorders of control. Either Control allowed physiology to get into a bad state, or Control did not get physiology out of a bad state.</br>
                    Bio-hacking requires understanding physiology from the perspective of Control.</br></br>
                    Good design heuristics make modular systems with designed interfaces. Evolution didn't do that. Modern living environments are very different than environments our ancestors evolved in. Not surprising a number of disorders that are common in the urban developed world are rare to unknown in the rural undeveloped world; things like diabetes, obesity, allergies, inflammatory disorders. This observation has lead to the “hygiene hypothesis”; the idea that there is a “factor” associated with “dirt” or lack of “hygiene” that is protective. This presents the hypothesis that the loss of ammonia oxidizing bacteria through modern bathing practices adversely affects the background nitric oxide level and so perturbs all NO-mediated control pathways, with no threshold.</br></br>
                    The importance of the background level of nitric oxide will be discussed in the context of a component of the human microbiome; ammonia oxidizing bacteria living on the skin and converting ammonia in sweat into nitrite and nitric oxide so as to set the background NO/NOx level to avoid nitropenia.</p><hr class="greenhr">

                    Neural networks in the brain are sparsely connected, composed of components with an over 50% failure rate, and still amazingly consistent in their high-level behavior over time.  We are building models of biologically plausible neural networks to help explain how the brain can protect against a malicious adversary while keeping networks tiny, low power, and easily trained. Using parameters taken from the somatosensory cortex, we have built a simulator to show the relationships between connectivity and severity of possible attacks. Some prior knowledge of distributed system design is helpful, and we'll teach you all of the neuroscience you need to know.</p><hr class="greenhr">

                    We live in a world shaped by the hacker ethos. Systems underlying the backbone of our daily lives - from government to finance to entertainment - have grown and evolved based in part on the ingenuity and input of people like you. What happens when we take that drive to understand, tinker, and (most of all) improve, and turn it towards the most complex system on Earth? Welcome to the world of biohacking. 
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Join two doctors/hackers and an infosec security pro as they take a deep dive into the realm of implantable mods, from the smallest DIY project to the cutting-edge in academic and industrial prototypes. This talk will also outline principles of successful human modification as well as highlight the need for caution at a time when innovation and imagination is pursued at the expense of security. But above all else, this talk is a celebration of the pioneering spirit of grinder culture and a call for hackers to continue to shape the future of what may be the most important movement in human history.

                    Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for the recording and the study of electrical activity of the brain taken from the scalp. The source of these brain signals is mostly the synaptic activity between brain cells (neurons). EEG activity is represented by different waveforms per second (frequencies) that can be used to diagnose or monitor different health conditions such as epilepsy, sleeping disorders, seizures, Alzheimer disease, among other clinical uses. On the other hand, brain signals are used for many other research and entertainment purposes, such as neurofeedback, arts and neurogaming.</br></br>
                    A brief introduction of BCIs (Brain-Computer Interfaces) and EEG will be given in order to understand the risks involved in our brain signals processing, storage and transmission.</br></br>
                    Live demos include the visualization of live brain activity, the sniffing of brain signals over TCP/IP as well as flaws in well-known EEG applications when dealing with some corrupted samples of the most widely used EEG file formats (e.g. EDF). This talk is a first approach to demonstrate that many EEG technologies are prone to common network and application attacks.</br></br>
                    Finally, best practices and regulatory compliance on digital EEG will be discussed.

                    It is predicted that the ability to read/write DNA cheaply at scale will revolutionize biology, but what happens after the DNA has been printed? I will explain the basics of genetic engineering at home and how it can be useful now and in the future. This talk will cover building a basic lab, DNA design and assembly, transformation of actual living organisms, and the relevant safety and security concerns. If time permits, I will talk about open source projects and engineering principles as applied to genetics. I will also briefly explain how this applies to human genome editing, even though I have been referring to the genetic engineering of microbes. This talk should provide you with a better understanding of genetic engineering and how to get started at home or a local hackerspace.

            <h2 class="title text-center">Vision</h2>
            <p class="intro text-left">
            It was only a matter of time: we are excited to announce the injection of the BioHacking Village (BHV) at DEF&nbsp;CON! Biological systems are still systems, and systems can be hacked. Thanks to ubiquitous cheap computing, DIY technology, and biological understanding, we’re on the cusp of revolution where anyone can engineer biology. The BHV this year will be a soft-launch distributed over several DEF&nbsp;CON areas, as we get our feet wet and gauge interest. Next year, at DEF&nbsp;CON 24, we plan to launch a full village.
            </p></br>
            <h2 class="title text-center">The Plan</h2>
            <p class="intro text-left">
            Presentations will be located in the Village Talks Track (Bronze 4) and it is a room not very far from our village. We are running a micro-village this year, but this year is a great opportunity to test the waters and get more of the DEF CON community interested and involved in BioHacking themselves and the world. Hack the planet! The village is located in the middle of the contest area (Bally's Event Center), which will give us high visibility and lots of random foot traffic. As you can probably tell by now, we are very excited to bring biology and bioengineering to the world's largest hacker convention. Please look out for us and please stop by, we will be a four table square with a BioHacking Village banner and various demos. We will have a limited amount of swag, but most of all we will have interesting demos, conversations, and you can sign up for our planning list if you want to become part of the DC_BHV volunteer staff. Also, speakers will be available at the booth at various random times through the conference for an informal Q&A.
            </p></br>
            <h2 class="title text-center">What is Biohacking?</h2>
            <p class="intro text-left">
            We believe that biohacking is the practice of approaching biology with a hacker’s perspective and philosophy. This includes much of the shared “hacker ethic”, such as: reverse-engineering, hands-on learning, information sharing, transparency, decentralization, free & fair access, world improvement and information security. The BHV focus on human augmentation and the current generation of genetic engineering known as synthetic biology.
            </br>
            </br>
            The state of bioengineering technology is much like computing before the transistor. Progress has been slow, haphazard and unpredictable. However, advances are now being made quickly. DNA printing and sequencing technology is becoming cheaper and faster at a quicker rate than Moore's Law. GMO yeast can be utilized as a chemical factory for biofuel and medicine while bacteria can be engineered to fight cancer or help clean contaminated soil. This is truly an exciting (and frightening) time for biohackers and humanity as a whole.
            </br>
            </br>
            On the human side, DARPA is working on an implantable thin-film memory prosthesis (for wounded veterans with traumatic brain injury), senses are being augmented through haptic feedback, and virtual reality is coming back full force. Perhaps as Icarus thought, “the sky's the limit”, but of course as Uncle Ben from Spider Man (and Voltaire) said, with great power comes great responsibility. Biotech has massive potential and implications for just about everyone.

            <h2 class="title">What should I expect?</h2>
                The BHV will focus on the two major areas of biohacking: human augmentation and genetic engineering. We are also interested in quantified self or health related content, but there will be no sales pitches! Companies can present demos and prototypes, perhaps even a finished product, but the content has to be compelling and clearly worth the audience’s time. 
                <br><br>
                We are going to give priority to content that is useful to the DEF&nbsp;CON community and the hacker community at large. We want to share practical and conceptual knowledge.

                <p>
                If you'd like to speak at the Biohacking Village this year, sorry, our CFP closed July 1st. If you'd like to do a demo, we may still have space for you, so email us ASAP. The CFP for DC24's BioHacking Village will open in very early 2016 and close much earlier than this year, just much better for planning and booking cheap travel. Watch for our tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/DC_BHV" target="_blank">@DC_BHV</a> for important updates before, during, and after DefCon 23... and for many neat biohacking & bioengineering retweets.<br><br>
