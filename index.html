                    What is cognitive memory? How can you “implant” a password into it? Is this truly secure? Curiosity around these questions prompted exploration of the research and concepts surrounding the idea of making the authentication process more secure by implanting passwords into an individual’s memory. The result? The idea is that you are not able to reveal your credentials under duress but you are still able to authenticate to a system. This talk will cover the stages of memory pertaining to encoding, storage and retrieval; the limitations of human memory; and the concept of serial interception sequence learning training. Current research and experimentation will be reviewed as well as the potential for forensic hypnosis to be used to “hack” this approach.

                    Travis Lawrence is currently a PhD candidate in Quantitative and Systems Biology at University of California, Merced. He developed an interest in both biodiversity and computers early in life. During college, he stumbled into the field of evolutionary biology which allowed him to pursue his interests in computer programming and biodiversity. The questions that are of the most interest to him are at the interface of evolutionary biology, genomics and bioinformatics.

                    Recent advances in genome editing have quickly turned ideas thought restricted to science fiction into reality such as custom synthetic organisms and designer babies. These technologies rely on the fidelity of the genetic code, which translates nucleotides into proteins. The underlying mechanism of translation is well understood where triplets of nucleotides, known as codons, are recognized by transfer RNAs with complementally nucleotide triplets. These transfer RNAs carry one of twenty amino acids which are then added to the growing protein chain by the ribosome. However, relatively little work has examined how a transfer RNA that recognizes a certain codon always carries the correct amino acid. The rules that determine which amino acid a transfer RNA carries have been termed the second genetic code. I have developed a computational method based on information theory that can elucidate the second genetic code from genomic sequences. Interestingly, the second genetic code is highly variable between organisms unlike the genetic code which is relatively static. I will present how my method cracks the second genetic code and how the variability of the second genetic code can be exploited to develop new treatments to combat bacterial infections and parasites, create targeted bio-controls to combat invasive species, and expand the genetic code to incorporate exotic amino acids.

                    Over the past decade, the ways we pursue human improvement have become increasingly invasive. We’ve so far been fortunate, but it’s likely if not inevitable that a death will occur due to biohacking.  This presentation discusses the many precautions being taken by biohackers to make our procedures and projects as safe as possible.

                    Lou Auguste is an entrepreneur in residence at the NYU Tandon incubator, Future Labs. He is passionate about microscopes, global health and creating jobs. His company Alexapath is at the forefront of AI based diagnostics and have collected awards from the ASME, Qualcomm, Singularity U, the Indian government, the British government and the US government.

                    Why can't microscopes diagnose disease? What if they could? For the past four years our team from NYU Tandon School of Engineering has been building an IoT system capable of turning a standard microscope into a digital imaging tool. And the goal is to connect every laboratory in the world into a global network.<br><br>
                    We call our device the Auto Diagnostic Assistant, or ADA, in honor of Ada Lovelace, who likely died from undiagnosed cervical cancer. We think the biohacking village will enjoy learning about ADA because it is an extremely low cost microscope accessory capable of accomplishing the same tasks that were previously only able to be accomplished with whole slide imaging devices. Perfect for biohackers looking to save, share, study and analyse images of specimens from their microscope.<br><br>
                    Our team is comprised of hardware engineers, software devs and machine learning computer scientists and our mission is to make diagnosis faster and easier. We have validated the accuracy of our mWSIs (mobile Whole Slide Images) with a pre-clinical study and presented our research as a poster at USCAP (United States and Canada Anatomical Pathology Conference). Additionally we published our original methods for creation of digital slides in the British Medical Journal (though the secret sauce has changed since then.)<br><br>
                    The hardware prototype of ADA won an award for best hardware led social innovation from the ASME in 2015. Currently, we are launching our beta trial in India with the support of the US Department of State and the Indian Department of Science and Technology. We are actively looking for beta testers in the US as well and would be happy to provide one unit for free to a visitor or member of the biohacking village.

                    Moderator Amir Kalali, MD
                    Amir was one of the original small group of DEFCON attendees that thought the introduction of Biology to DEFCON would be a great idea. Once this small group had penetrated the locked meeting room assigned to them, it was clear that a diverse group of DEFCON attendees had backgrounds and interest in the both biology and technology. Amir believes that this century will be remembered as the century that biology and technology merged to enhance humankind. Amir has a background in medicine, neuroscience, product development and thinks of himself as a translator between the worlds of biology and technology. He is keenly interested in the ethical issues that are raised by biohacking that need to be discussed and addressed.

                  Amy Kruse, PHD
Chief Scientific Officer
Platypus Institute 
In 2005, as the Program Manager for DARPA’s performance-focused neuroscience research program, Amy effectively created the field that the Platypus Institute focuses on. As a starting point, she named the field, coining the two most commonly used names for their research: “Applied Neuroscience,” and “Accelerated Learning.” She also conducted the seminal research - a series of studies where she definitely demonstrated that, with biofeedback and brainwave analysis, one could dramatically (and rapidly) enhance military sniper’s performance. Since that time, in a variety of capacities, Amy’s extensive research has addressed a broad range of foundational questions including: how human performance is affected by different natural conditions like sleep deprivation and stress; how elite performance can be enhanced with the use of electrical brain stimulation; and how video gaming technology can be leveraged to accelerate learning speeds. Most recently, prior to joining The Platypus Institute, Amy served as the Vice President and Chief Technology Officer for Cubic Global Defense. Amy has an interest of the ethical implications of her work and other methods of biohacking.

David Ishee is a self taught biohacker from Mississippi who originally got into Biohacking as as extension of his dog breeding program. He's been breeding working dogs for most of his life and feels strongly that genetic engineering and advanced biotechnology are needed to fix the genetic problems facing most populations of domestically bred animals. He's been working to prove that the technology to create genetically modified animals has advanced to the point that it's now within the reach of dog breeders with minimal additional equipment and cost. His immediate goals are to demonstrate this by creating a litter of genetically modified dogs in his shed/lab of mostly hacked together equipment, then to create an information center for other animal breeders to get education, instructions and tools for using these techniques themselves.

                    In an era of rapidly evolving technological advances, the ethical and regulatory frameworks are always playing catch up. Biohacking may have consequences that much more serious than traditional technologies. It is critical that as a community we discuss and try and address the ethical implications of biohacking. A wide range of topics will be discussed by the panel and the audience including: What are the ethical implications of the hacker mindset, the ability to experiment outside of traditional research settings with their safeguards, the use of methodologies developed by non benign parties, the unforeseen consequences of new discoveries, and should we build for billionaires or the billions?

                    Among ‘Internet of Things’ security research, there is one branch that no one has wanted to touch, until now: The Internet of Dongs. Internet connected sex toys in all shapes, sizes and capabilities are available on the market with many more being developed. Like many IoT devices, IoD devices suffer a great many security and privacy vulnerabilities. These issues are all the more important when you consider the private and intimate nature of these devices. To research this, the Internet of Dongs project was founded (https://internetofdon.gs).<br>
                    This talk will explore this under researched branch of IoT and the security and privacy threats that exist. It will also cover the IoD projects efforts to bring information security best practices to the adult toy industry.

                    In recent months it seems like not a week passes where you do not encounter a headline that states that a healthcare organization has been held for ransom or in some other way involved in a breach. Healthcare has been a sector that has routinely been described as being lax with the implementation and enforcement of information security controls and the challenges faced by healthcare organizations are growing as attackers begin to look past EHR and PACS systems and target the medical devices within them. That older but still very functional computerized medical supply cabinet which was installed to improve the efficiency of operations can now be seen as a liability in that its aging unpatched control node may contain hundreds of unpatched vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities that in the case of malware like Medjack can be used to compromise the device and use it as a staging ground for attacks against other hospital systems. In some cases, however, the risk goes beyond just a breach vector and can directly impact human life. What if that infusion pump’s dosage was illegitimately changed or the pacemaker programming made malicious? What if Brickerbot took out a surgical robot or a heart monitor at a critical time? These issues could readily give a whole new meaning to the term Denial of Service and cannot be ignored. While the FDA recently issued some guidance for the manufacturers of such devices, the secure deployment of such devices is also critical for security as all of the security features in the world are useless if no one terms them on or configures them improperly. This presentation will discuss the OWASP Secure Medical Device Deployment Standard and requisite methods that can be used to securely deploy medical devices in order to help to prevent their compromise as well as mitigate the damage that can occur if a successful compromise were to occur.

                    In recent years, direct-to-consumer genetic testing services have given people the freedom to cheaply test their DNA. We have entered a new era where our own biological source code can be explored, allowing hackers to reverse-engineer the most complex machines in the universe: the human body. This data tells us about our ancestral origins, what makes us unique, and how our health may be influenced by our genetic predispositions.<br><br>
                    These developments are exiting, but this new frontier is clouded by concerns about safety, privacy, and ethics. Recent developments in governmental regulation bring into question our rights as individuals to freely have our genes tested. We as hackers must unite to ensure that the human source code remains open source.<br><br>
                    How do we embrace this technology to promote individual freedoms, accelerate research, and ultimately save lives without this information falling into wrong or abusive hands? How do we as hackers hack ourselves in a safe responsible way, and what can we expect to happen regarding government regulation? We will discuss these issues, and share our experiences as geneticists in studying our own code to better understand our health. We will also tell you about an open source science experiment we're running that will allow anyone to freely participate in genomic research for the betterment of human health and longevity.

                    Our biomechanically focused, proprietary interface designs result in improved outcomes, greater patient acceptance and are backed by evidence-based clinical support. In conjunction with his practice, Alley has worked with DEKA Research and Development as their prosthetic interface design consultant for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) “Revolutionizing Prosthetics Project” chartered to develop the next generation of military upper limb prosthesis (a.k.a. the “Luke Arm”). Randy is currently the Principle Investigator on biodesigns’ own DARPA/SBIR Phase II contract.

                    Very often amputees, prosthetists, manufacturers and particularly the general public are all excited to hear about the latest developments in prosthetic components such as feet, ankles, knees and hands. And while these components have improved significantly over the last decade there is one area that has essentially been overlooked. And it’s an area that is arguably the most critical in terms of an individual’s comfort, control, proprioception, and overall health. I am of course talking about the prosthetic socket, or interface. The socket is universal to all upper & lower limb prosthetic systems and without it, prosthetic systems simply would not exist. Today nearly all prosthetic wearers are in sockets that provide limited biomechanical control and therefore outcomes are sub-par at best. Common wearer complaints include poor socket fit, inability for it to stay on or to be worn for long periods of time, excessive heat, skin irritations, poor performance among others.<br><br>
                    This presentation will highlight the biomechanical differences of traditional sockets that merely encapsulate a residual limb to that of the High-Fidelity™ (HiFi) Interface that uses skeletal capture and control principles that result in increased comfort, increased performance, a trend toward gait symmetry, as well as improved range of motion, energy efficiency and overall user success. Perhaps the most interesting development resulting from osseostabilization is enhanced connectivity and proprioception. By mimicking the motions of the skeleton it is believed we are in effect “fooling” the brain into believing the lost arm or leg is back, a key component in the process of becoming whole again.

                    In the past few years, software has started to “eat” healthcare in a new way. Historically, software was predominately a productivity enhancement for healthcare, but now software is emerging as a medical device. Many companies are releasing their own versions of digital medicines. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) apps are coming to market that improve sleep well without pills or potions. Companies like Akili Interactive are building clinically-validated cognitive therapeutics, assessments, and diagnostics that look and feel like high-quality video games for pediatric ADHD. But how do we know any of these products work? Clinical trials and research are adapting to support the rise of digital medicine and more research is moving out of the lab and intro the home. We'll look at the new models that are supporting this trend, including a dive into Ethereum, a blockchain technology that can decentralize clinical trials, provide an economic incentive to join the trials, and endow participants with stronger rights and security for their data. We’ll share what the future could hold for at home research, digital medicine, and blockchains.

                    In a world filled with danger emanating from all sorts of digital channels, having a proxy (or two) that you create, control, manage and direct is not just useful, but a requirement. Instead of worrying about an ineffectual government or an incomprehensible privacy policy, it’s possible that fake identities are a way to take ownership of the problem. Fake identities in the hands of the individual, are the way to swing the pendulum of privacy back to the people. The presentation will present our progress at building tools for people to implement fake identities to use offline and online. At the time of writing this abstract our users have 2 million active fake identities and the number is growing daily. These identities are used for dating, shopping, selling, social media, political statements and for numerous other uses.

                    One of the huge criticisms of Security research is the lack of process and adherence to traditional research methods. Quite often our "research" is just tearing apart systems and exposing their vulnerabilities. While this is useful, there is a better way. This talk will walk through the process of how I used the scientific method to conduct the research that led to my 2011 insulin pump findings. By changing just a couple steps in our research, I think that we can bring more outside credibility to our hard, and important work.

            <h2 class="title text-center">Call for Papers 2018</h2>
            <p class="intro text-left">
The DEF CON Biohacking Village is a multi-day biotechnology conference focused on breakthrough DIY, grinder, transhumanist, medical technology, and information security along with its related communities in the open source ecosystem. There have been multiple instances of DIYBio overcoming conventional science. We want to celebrate the biohacker movement with a compendium of talks, demonstrations, and a medical device hackathon.<br>
<br>
The 2018 BioHacking Village theme is Medical Industry Disrupt. The Medical Industry is one of the last to be touched by technology. We have placed doctors and the study of medicine on an alter for years; the time of ivory towers, pedestals, and information isolation has come to an end. Biohackers are working on projects that have traditionally been kept in the labs of the medical institutions. We are moving science forward by working on DIY projects that matter and use citizen science to solve the economic problems that are caused by privatizing medicine and the resources for research.<br>
<br>
Our goal is to extend beyond the scope of mission driven technology. This event and the community behind it place a strong emphasis on diversity, inclusiveness, education, collaboration, and contribution. The BioHacking Village is also focused on helping developers learn the skills and other factors associated with successful careers in biotechnology and software development. The event aims to provide opportunities to interact with like-minded scientists and developers, to learn from one another, as well as help each other see opportunities that may be available.<br>
<br>
We welcome anyone interested in do-it-yourself biology. Biohackers reject the idea that all medical, biological, and genetic advancements must come from a large institutions, university, or corporation. We reject the idea that modifications to biology must only be in response to disease or dysfunction. We reject the natural order given to us by evolution… or perhaps we have evolved to the point where we can take evolution into our own hands. We dare to ask the questions: How can we use technology to enhance our raw abilities, specific skills, overall health, or well-being? How can we usher in an age where we not only fix what’s broken, but we make ourselves, and our world, better?

            <h2 class="title">Instruction for Authors</h2>
Like all hackers, we are looking to subvert the dominant paradigm...of life itself. Your talk should excite, elucidate, enlighten, and engage participants in the technical, mechanical, procedural, and human side of biohacking.<br>
<br>
We are seeking three kinds of submissions: talks, demos, and labs.<br>
<br>
<span class="purple_text bold">Talks</span> are the standard non-interactive presentation style, generally with slides, where one or several people enlighten, educate, and inspire the audience on an interesting topic or project.<br>
<br>
<span class="purple_text bold">Demos</span> also stick to the presentation, one-to-many format, but the presenter uses most of the time to display a working technology, in real time, and may involve some level of audience interactivity.<br>
<br>
<span class="purple_text bold">Labs</span> are purely hands on for the participants, who can wander in and DIY their way into biohacking. There is very little instruction, and when there is, it is one-on-one. Examples in other villages include the lock trees in the Lockpicking Village, and the tamper-evident kits in the Tamper Evident Village. Submitters are expected to provide their own materials.<br>
<br>
In your submission, please indicate which you are applying for, but don’t worry too much if you aren’t sure. Take your best guess, and if we like your topic, we can easily change the submission type for you.<br>
<br>
We require: A title, an abstract, outline, and presenter bio(s). If you have additional materials, such as an early draft of your slides or presentation text, please feel free to attach.<br>
<br>
Time slots: Talk times can either be 30 minutes or 60 minutes with a demonstration. Please select your preference on the form. We reserve the right to pick a different time slot for you.<br>
<br>
AV: Please let us know if you have AV or technical requirements besides the standard projector and mic.<br>
<br>
Multiple Submissions: You are allowed to separately submit as many papers as you like.<br>
<br>
Your submission will be held to the following standards:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li class="green_text">
<span class = "purple_text">
Scientific rigor – 
</span>
<span class="white_text">
Was the project conducted in accordance with the scientific method, and were any hypotheses properly investigated? Are less-scientific aspects of the topic acknowledged as such? If you’re not making any scientific claims, does your technology actually work? Or, if it was a failure, is it acknowledged as such with a detailed and interesting description of lessons-learned?
</span>
</li>
<li class="green_text">
<span class = "purple_text">
Significance – 
</span>
<span class="white_text">
Is your project significant to the biohacking and scientific community? Does it add value, for either scientific, technological, ethical, cultural, or artistic purposes?
</span>
</li>
<li class="green_text">
<span class = "purple_text">
Originality – 
</span>
<span class="white_text">
Is your project an original work, or at least sufficiently different from the work it builds on? (Exceptions can be made, especially for introductory & educational 101 talks.)
</span>
</li>
<li class="green_text">
<span class = "purple_text">
Coolness – 
</span>
<span class="white_text">
Extra points will be given for the “cool” factor. We want to be wowed. We want our jaws to drop in wonder. We want to be blown away with the inspiring possibility that you have made reality. Amaze us.

No Spam Zone:
</span>
<span class="white_text">
No sales-focused talks or demos. Product demos or brief mention of products may be appropriate if the audience walks away with a deeper understanding of the actual technology or science involved. The focus needs to be on knowledge and skills, not on promoting a specific for-fee product. Spammers will be immediately rejected!

The BHV celebrates global health ingenuity arising from maker communities from the dynamic perspective of emerging biology, technology, and human-enhancement. In one year, we have more than doubled our talks and tripled the number of attendees. The BioHacking Village has grown from a small half village of 11 talks and demos to a full village with 28 non-stop talks and demonstrations with standing room only and entrance lines that exceeded capacity.<br>
<br>
Whether your interest lies in security, technology, engineering, science, humanities, design, or fabrication, donors to the BioHacking Village can be assured they are reaching an audience of unapologetically enthusiastic innovators.<br>
