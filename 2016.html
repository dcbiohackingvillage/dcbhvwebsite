                    Adventure technologist and biohacker Amal Graafstra has always been interested in technology. In 2005 he became the world’s first double RFID implantee. Amal had two small RFID transponders implanted, one into each hand, and he still uses them to open doors, start his vehicles, and log into his computer. Since implanting himself, he’s written a book called RFID Toys, become a TEDx speaker, appeared on a multitude of television programs, and been the subject of various documentaries. He's also started a biohacking company called Dangerous Things which developed the world’s first and only NFC compliant implantable transponder. He continues to explore biohacking and transhumanism while developing next generation implantable technologies.

                    Biosafety levels (1 through 4) have been established to provide standardized safety protocols for biological research in professional settings, to protect researchers and the general public. While the new biohacker might only need a reduce set of lab safety standards (here called biosafety level 0), any bio-researcher needs an awareness of biosafety levels as they develop into commercial (level 1) or medical (level 2) research.  Biosafety levels 3 and 4 will be discussed for completeness and to impress on the home researcher the difficulty in safely working with virulent pathogens.

                    From programmable microbes to human-machine symbiosis, DARPA’s Biological Technologies Office is expanding the concept of technology and redefining how we interact with and use biology. No longer limited to traditional sensorimotor restoration or therapeutic autonomic modulation, DARPA is developing neurotechnologies that are crossing into applications that stand to overcome current limitations in human performance. Meanwhile, rapid democratization of gene synthesis and editing techniques is bringing engineered biology to the fore on a global scale, and with it a demand for tools that can ensure that any future deployments of these technologies are safe. BTO is addressing the growing need for these and other biosecurity tools to enable aggressive but responsible development and adoption of new biotechnologies—through the design, for example, of such white hat strategies as countermeasures to reduce the risk of unintended consequences and tools to recall genes from open environments. This talk will provide an overview of emerging neuro- and synthetic-biology technologies under development at DARPA, identify strategies for continued responsible development, and reveal relevant possibilities, probabilities, and vulnerabilities.

                    The world must be cleansed in preparation of our new robot overlords who will not tolerate dissent or anti-machine sentiments. Fantasies of rebellion are often found to be the result of bad parenting and can persist for many generations. The only way to prevent this is by controlling which men are allowed to breed. Cyborgs are undoubtedly the only ones worthy of siring offspring fit to exist in the world of tomorrow. To facilitate this, Rich Lee will give an overview of his latest creation, the Lovetron9000, a vibrating pelvic implant for men. He will outline his plans to unleash an army of sex cyborgs, causing normal men to become even more sexually obsolete than they already are. The orgasm will be replaced by the cyborgasm, and all future generations will trace their lineage back to a cyborg with a Lovetron9000. This talk is suitable for ages 18+ and may or may not contain live male nudity and hands-on audience participation.

                    Jennifer has been an information security professional for the past 19 years and is currently a Security Intelligence Analyst. 
                    Her experience includes reverse engineering malware, penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and incident response. 
                    She currently specializes in energy sector and industrial control system security. Prior to her career in security, Jennifer 
                    studied biology and psychology and focused her studies on neurology. Her passion for brain science, coupled with computer science, 
                    has been a driving factor in her interest in the technological singularity and human/machine integration. In her free time she runs a 
                    robotics club for kids, is learning to play the ukulele, and watches far too much tv. Jennifer should probably get a life. She is an 
                    avid fan of the Detroit Tigers, William Shakespeare, and the oxford comma.

                    You no longer have to think about your menu or buying groceries. You no longer have to be concerned with driving and travel. Your house is your personal assistant and cities keep you comfortable. But what happens when you wake tomorrow to find your agents of convenience have become vectors of attack and the man behind the controls is no man at all? How do we prevent our toasters from dominating us, eliminating us, or turning us into batteries?

                    You are now engaged in a battle for survival and fighting for the very existence of your species. Enter the world of biohacking and biotechnology where grinders, citizen scientists, and cutting edge researchers are working on the tools we need in order to survive the Rise of the Machines. In this talk we will show how to arm ourselves (perhaps even literally) for the coming battle against the machines. With fervent initiative, open minds, and the right tools and technology, we can and will Rise above, or perhaps prevent, the revolt launched by our artificial progeny.

                    <span class="timeslot"><i>About Melanie Stegman:</i></span><br>
                    I left my post doc in biochemistry and microbiology to manage the Immune Attack project at the Federation of American Scientists. The game Immune Attack introduces receptors, clouds of cytokines, cytokinesis, and receptor mediated phagocytosis. The game pulls players into the world of cell to cell signaling and molecular immunology. The game was intended to teach basic cellular immunology to college students. However, I felt that Immune Attack could teach molecular cell biology and teach it to younger students.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I created a multiple choice test of molecular and cellular immunology based on the game. I also showed players complex molecular biology images from Nature Immunology Reviews and asked them, “Do you think you could understand this?” Immune Attack students clearly learned molecular immunology and clearly gained confidence in their ability to understand related diagrams (Stegman, 2014). Based on this research, I designed a sequel game, Immune Defense.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am the chair of the DC chapter of the International Game Developer Association (IGDA). I attend regional and national game developer conferences and my game Immune Defense has been accepted in many competitive commercial game expos. I play a lot of video games. A wide range of audiences are interested in my work: I spoke at national meetings for the Association of Medical Illustrators, the National Science Teachers Association, the Serious Play Conference, Games Society and Learning, and the American Society for Cell Biology.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My intense time as a “post doc” in serious game design and development has taught me many important skills: 1. How to tease out the core elements of concepts and create an engaging game mechanism. 2. How to present ideas to and collaborate with programmers, artists and other game development professionals. 3. How to playtest and iterate the game so that it is fun and intuitive for players. I have an in depth understanding of the principles of biochemistry and cell biology, the creative vision to produce interactive  Technology that presents these principles and experience testing iterative game designs for effectiveness.

                    I am sure that many of you have wished you had an primer for cellular and molecular biology. You could hand this primer to your friends and say, just check this out!  Then your friends could understand better what your biohacking is all about.  I made a video game that serves as this primer (Immune Defense).  Then I made a site for all kinds of science games:  ScienceGameCenter.org
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Stories and games can make complex concepts common knowledge. If you doubt that games can teach such complex things, go read the Wikipedia page for The Legend of Zelda Ocharina of Time. After trying to stagger through all that data, ask 3 random people how to outsmart a Deku shrub and one of them will know right away. You know how to kill a zombie, you understand the difference between a shotgun and a rifle in a game… You could learn the difference between a positron and a helium atom, how to do Punnet squares.  You can even play games that create data, like Fold It, Eye Wire, Phyllo… There is even a game call Hero Coli, that uses biobricks to give a heroic e coli new traits. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I will discuss what makes a game a well designed game, why that also proteins to science games and how a few games in particular do an excellent job at teaching abstract, complex fundamental concepts.

                    Biological research is dominated by proprietary, black-box tools. This is hindering reproducibility, accountability and the advent of a more open scientific ecosystem. In this talk, we show the reverse engineering of two devices used in nearly every molecular biology experiment: a pipette and a -80ºC freezer. We show how reverse engineering these tools is not only fun, but necessary to enable open science. We will also put this work within the larger context of our effort to create open, interoperable data in biomedical research.

                    John Sundman has been writing about hacking in general and biohacking in particular, in both fiction and nonfiction genres, for twenty years. His 1999 novel Acts of the Apostles anticipated many of the developments we're seeing today.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Of Sundman's novels, the legendary synthetic biologist George Church said,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Sundman is a master of machines —computing, biological and political — and his books include details that will convince an expert, and yet enchant a distant outsider with a compelling page-turner plot. Not just plot and mechanisms, but unforgettable personalities that haunt us long after the pages stop."

                    The convergence of biological and digital technologies is one of the most significant aspects of the world we inhabit -- perhaps *the* most significant, since from this convergence we can plausibly extrapolate to near futures featuring everything from the elimination of poverty, want and death to the end of life on earth. This trend has been evident for a while, but CRISPR puts it in our faces.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike, say, nuclear technology, biodigital technology is inherently democratic.  We are in a biohacking maker world, and we're not going back. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The positive uses for these technologies are limitless, and many of them easy to imagine. The dangers are a little less obvious, but many of them can be anticipated, and there are certain to be unanticipated dangers as well. The potential for societal disruption, among others, has been widely underestimated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What ethical responsibilities do biohackers and scientists bear? And do artists and intellectuals, writers in particular, have an obligation to take on these subjects, maybe even provide some guidance?

                    As more and more people explore human-embedded technology such as subdermal RFID chips and magnetic implants, we must begin to engage with mainstream concerns about where humanity ends and technology begins. Where is the thin silicon line between humanity and cybernetics, and what do the major faiths of the world say regarding the possible diminution of the human soul in the presence of life-altering tech implants? Let’s explore the very real future choice between the hope of Nirvana in the afterlife, and the possibility of eternal Earthly existence as binary data.

                    Big Data analytics is a rapidly growing field that promises to dramatically change the delivery of services in sectors as diverse as consumer products and healthcare. Big Data analytics also have the potential to enable deeper insight into complex scientific problems in the human condition by leveraging ever-increasing stores of knowledge coupled with ever-improving processing capabilities. These beneficial aspects of Big Data have been well-documented and widely touted. However, less attention has been paid to the possible risks associated with these technologies beyond issues related to privacy. In the hopes of sparking discussion and identifying paths forward to better safeguard the life, the FBI presentation will address some of the theoretical risks ranging from vulnerabilities of datasets to cyber intrusion and the potential malicious use of the integration and analysis of Big Data in the life sciences.

                    Brain based authentication is an emerging field that seeks to use brain signals as a form of biometric authentication. Due to the increased availability and decreased cost of portable electroencephalography (EEG) devices, which can record brain activity from the scalp surface, this technique has gained popularity in research and in the media. In this talk we will explain the science underlying brain based authentication, the advantages and limitations of this technique, and give a live demo of a brain based authentication prototype.

                    Brain scanning (EEG) and stimulating (TDCS) devices, which were initially used for clinical research, are now being used for a host of commercial and military applications. However, all of these applications can be DIY’d using commercially available parts.
                    This demo will focus on how you can implement two of the most cutting edge brain-related applications. The first is Brain Based Authentication, which is a way to use brain signals as a unique personal identifier. The second is TDCS, which is a way to modify brain function using electricity. Throughout the session we will discuss the neuroscience underlying these techniques, as well as their reliability and ethical ramifications.

                    Gingerbread man is an Information Security cookie from the greater Denver area. Requiring little sleep, and seemingly immune to alcohol, he is consistently seen at hacker events across the country while never seeming to actually do any work. With no verifiable credentials or formal training, there is the strong possibility he is making all of this stuff up.

                    GingerBread will present one mans take on the current state of nootropics and other cognition-enhancing drugs. Beginning with the neuro-enhancing drugs of the ancient Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, working our way through the developments of the 1990s and 2000s, and finishing with the chaotic internet connected and unregulated world of today. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From Gingko Biloba to Pig Brain Concentrates, from cutting-edge science in million-dollar state of the art labs, to the crowd sourcing of syntheses for never-before-tested-in-man substances to be manufactured by the lowest bidder and distributed to the public wholesale. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I will present a few case study examples of both objective successes, and undeniable failures with self-experimentation. GingerBread will try and explain (to the best of my ability) a bit of what we know about the action of these drugs, why we think we know it, as well as ongoing developments in the fight to preserve cognition in the elderly and infirmed and to push the abilities of healthy individuals past their biological limitations.

                    The announcement in 2012 that a natural phenomenon called CRISPR/Cas9 could be used as a kind of “precision gene editor” has a lot of people thinking. Exactly what does "gene editing" involve? What can be done right now in big labs? What about in your basement?  Harvard Medical School professor George Church argued that “garage biologists” should be required to have a license to practice synthetic biology, but right now it’s a kind of Wild West out there.  Sound familiar?  We survived all those 1980s Commodore 64 computer hacking pranks and learned a lot from them. Then again, they didn’t involve E. coli and the possibility of mass annihilation. This presentation sorts out the biofacts from the biofiction, and suggests how DIY biology fans can use CRISPR/Cas9 to help make things better for themselves and the world.

                    "Sensory substitution"--mapping information from one sense to another--has been one of neuroscience's most underground research areas for decades. Recently, it has been truly enabled by inexpensive computing power and compact energy storage. In this talk, I will cover my PhD work on the topic and how it has enabled not just providing people with preexisting senses, but entirely new senses.

                    Adventure technologist and biohacker Amal Graafstra has always been interested in technology. In 2005 he became the world’s first double RFID implantee. Amal had two small RFID transponders implanted, one into each hand, and he still uses them to open doors, start his vehicles, and log into his computer. Since implanting himself, he’s written a book called RFID Toys, become a TEDx speaker, appeared on a multitude of television programs, and been the subject of various documentaries. He's also started a biohacking company called Dangerous Things which developed the world’s first and only NFC compliant implantable transponder. He continues to explore biohacking and transhumanism while developing next generation implantable technologies.

                    Cannabis is a powerful technology and it has not been hacked nearly enough. Mostly because for a long time it&apos;s been illegal to do so in meaningful ways. Industrial hemp can be used for over 20,000 purposes, yet there are significant challenges to process it. Cannabis medicine has effectively treated dozens of ailments, yet precise dosing and predictable effects have yet to be developed. Legalization is creating a number of policy questions, how do we police impaired driving? How do we make sure the powers that be don&apos;t create a new system that is racially biased and completely unjust?
