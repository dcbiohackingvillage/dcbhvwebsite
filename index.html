                    This is a journey into fitness.  My fitness and more importantly your fitness.  Or rather the information that I've been collecting every day at the gym while getting ready for bikini season.  This a look at my journey to become the sexy stud muffin you see before you (google image search "sexy stud muffin" for reference) and my quest to do bad things through various means, up to and including compromising cardio equipment, fitness apps, and changing delivery addresses for fitness equipment to my house instead of your gym. No zero days and nothing overly technical provided here, but the intended takeaway is awareness of who is collecting your PHI and from where. Just like on Maury, the results will shock and amaze.  Or maybe you'll just get a good laugh at my journey to lose 100 pounds.

                    Over the past decade, the ways we pursue human improvement have become increasingly invasive. We’ve so far been fortunate, but it’s likely if not inevitable that a death will occur due to biohacking.  This presentation discusses the many precautions being taken by biohackers to make our procedures and projects as safe as possible.

                    Editing genes is getting easier as knowledge of various genomes and technology  advance. Malicious actors creating novel or custom infectious agents are a growing concern. This presentation explores use of Cyber Kill Chain methodology
                    to detect and disrupt potential bioterrorist activities. Each link in the chain is defined and examined to identify potential attack indicators and countermeasures, discussing notable bottlenecks in each step. The goal is to
                    apply existing information security knowledge and paradigms to counter the would-be bioterrorist. This talk will include brief discussions of current gene editing methods (CRISPR-CAS9, ZINCFINGER) for the lay person. Familiarity with the Cyber Kill Chain would be useful.

                    "Healthcare is enamored with data. We have more data than we know what to do with (e.g., constant flows of data from wearables, new and cheaper ways to sequence genomes, digital phenotypes expressed through social media interactions) and there is a rush to deploy this data in clinical research and care. As we combine this “data”, we start to build a digital replica of each human. Our healthcare data carries new weight, new responsibilities. The rise in data means that we are gaining a greater body of knowledge as we assemble a digital representation of a person. We are getting closer to full understanding of someone’s biology, brain structure, how and why they think and do what they do. We are entering into a world where precision medicine and “N of 1” studies is (finally) becoming possible. On the flipside, we are also entering into a period of unprecedented monitoring and surveillance. As a society, we have standards for how we handle human blood, tissue and other human specimens. It’s now time for us to talk more about how we are to handle our digital specimens. In the talk, we’ll discuss the proliferation of our biometric and psychographic data, use cases, and the new ethical and custodial responsibilities that arise for individuals, regulators and companies."

                    "Natural selection can produce marvelous functional systems, but constraints in the evolutionary process can be exploited. By leveraging humanity’s relative advantage in design foresight, we may be able to create synthetic organisms that can out-compete their natural counterparts.
                    In this talk, I will explore the design limitations of evolved organisms that leave ecosystems permanently vulnerable to attack. In order to protect the natural world and human health, I will advocate we adopt the “biosecurity mindset” and improve our ecological security posture."

                    Recent advances in remote sensing, drones, distributed computing, bigdata, and environmental DNA offer an unprecedented opportunity to push epidemiology beyond its traditional, two-dimensional (i.e. map-based) approach and harness the full availability and power of three-dimensional data and novel investigation methods to explore such data. This talk will present an extremely technology-specific vision for achieving this.
                    Examples of the potential usefulness of this approach will be demonstrated with respect to three scenarios:  (1) avian flu, (2) asthma, and post-flooding fecal contamination. The current state of the art of the component technologies will be presented as well as the remaining challenges for their seamless integration.

                    To quote Bob Marley “If you know your history, then you would know where you coming from”. This talk is a retrospective on the last ten years or so of medical device security research, intended to bring hackers interested in this discipline up to speed on what has been accomplished to date, how it was done, why it matters and where we stand today.
                    This talk will timeline all the major events in medical device security research, describing in technical detail what was accomplished and how. This should make evident some of the systemic vulnerability classes present in medical devices and hopefully give the medical device security researchers of tomorrow a good idea of where to start looking.
                    It will also cover some of the basic tools and techniques needed to get started in this discipline, as well as some of the practicalities involved in obtaining devices, firmware and information on various classes of medical devices and how differences in attack surface may influence your choice of devices to target for research.

                    Two years ago, the Four Thieves Vinegar Collective became public at HOPE XI after almost a decade of working underground, and debuted the first generation of the Apothecary Microlab, the open-source automated chemical reactor designed to synthesize the active ingredients of pharmaceutical drugs. We synthesized Daraprim onstage, and called Martin Shkreli's cell phone from stage. It was a good time. Since then, the reactor has developed, and we have worked on more complicated syntheses, and hacking medical hardware. Most notably, we released plans for a DIY version of the EpiPen anyone can make for $30US. Come see the new releases we have planned and the new beta unit. Learn how to make medicine from poison, how to use the shrouding of information about medicine to make custom-tailored treatment programs for rare diseases, and how to use public data to find new, more efficient synthesis pathways for drugs.

                    "As prenatal testing and ultrasound technology have greatly improved, so has our ability to diagnose birth defects and genetic diseases earlier and earlier in pregnancy. Until recently, our only available options were to offer pregnancy termination or wait to see if the baby survived long enough to be treated after birth. But what if we had the capability to intervene before those genetic mutations had a chance to cause their harmful effects, sparing parents from the agony of uncertain pregnancy outcomes and saving children from debilitating diseases? In last year’s “Designer Babies: Hacking Human Embryos” we discussed pre-implantation genetic testing and embryo modification as a means to identify and treat heritable diseases, by correcting harmful gene mutations before a pregnancy even begins. Since then, exciting new research has shown that even after a pregnancy is under way, opportunities still exist for hacking the biological machinery of the fetus to alter its developmental course.This talk will review new and rapidly evolving strategies to treat genetic disease in utero – while the baby is still in the womb - by hijacking the embryologic mechanisms responsible for fetal growth and development.
                    Examples include:<br>
                        - injection of a critical protein into the amniotic fluid surrounding babies with X-linked hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia, a genetic condition causing a lack of sweat glands and the life-threatening inability to regulate temperature<br>
                        - transfusion of mesenchymal stem cells into the fetal umbilical cord to treat osteogenesis imperfecta or “brittle bone disease”<br>
                        - in utero blood and bone marrow transplant to treat the fatal hemoglobin disorder alpha-thalessemia major<br>
                        - correcting deformities such as cleft lip and palate by triggering cell signaling pathways ""knocked out"" by genetic mutation "

                        Over Mind is a a low-cost technology/system developed in Chile, designed to give mobility to 1% of the world population, increasing its available physical capacities allowing people with zero or reduced mobility to MOVE and carry out activities on their own, granting freedom and autonomy.
                        The year 2016 Over Mind participated in the contest ""An idea to change history"", organized by History Channel together with 5,800 projects and it was the only Chilean project that finished among the four finalists."

                                While important changes may be afoot in the US regulatory environment for medical devices, which should hopefully allow more people to make informed decisions regarding patient safety, many CISOs, security engineers, and network admins have to live day to day in the world we have, not the world we wish for.  There have been multiple presentations in the last few years about the details of medical device security that have rightly put the onus on manufacturers to provide long term fixes.  However, we wonder if there are ways to create a more defensible and hardened hospital room until the notoriously slow regulatory process gains traction.We’ve done deep dives into specific medical devices and we’ve done pentests in several hospital systems.  In our experience, we have noticed broad classes of common vulnerabilities across bedside equipment that transcend any one device or class of device.  Input validation errors, buggy network stacks, and low-bandwidth links can be found in systems that monitor vitals, administer medications, or in components that glue disparate systems together.  A long awaited patch may fix one vulnerability only for the hospital to bring in a different device for clinical or financial reasons, and wash-rinse-repeat.  It’s not enough for one or two manufacturers to step up the security game if they are feeding data into other unreliable systems, and it will be a while before everyone is at the same level. We are dedicated red teamers, and we may feel the pain of those in the blue team trying to do the right thing, but we don’t know what it’s like to live in your shoes.  In this talk, we will explain, in broad terms, vulnerabilities that we have seen and how we recommend remediating them.  But we don’t want you to leave this session feeling that we are talking down to the defenders.  We want you to have a seat at the table and share how you handle the unknown in your environment.

                    Biological viruses have existed and evolved for millions of years, maliciously exploiting host cells for survival. How have they done this, and what can we learn from it?
                    Extremely advanced mechanisms for privilege escalation, persistence, and defence evasion have been used by biological viruses long before malware was first written.
                    This talk will provide an understanding of what mechanisms are used by biological viruses to exploit immune defences, persist, and survive in the arms race with the immune system.
                    Surprising differences between malware and virus actions will be shown, and some mechanisms which are used by viruses, but have not been adopted, or even attempted by malware, will be revealed.
                    No biological background is needed, only an open mind.

                    Thanks to the use of DNA in criminal investigations, hundreds of innocent people have been exonerated from crimes they did not commit.  DNA has also been used to used to arrest suspects in cold cases!  In my presentation I will give a primer on the techniques used for DNA profiling and the statistics for false positives.  The bulk of my presentation will be looking into the vulnerabilities of
                    current DNA profiling methods and how a malicious actor could actually reconstruct enough genotypic information of any innocent person from just a picture of their face.  This is based on recently published Nature Genetics research and extends the methods to suggest that it would only take ~50 million face:genotype samples to have a sufficient genotypic mapping that would allow someone to recreate your 23andMe profile (602,000 SNPs) from a selfie.

            <h2 class="title text-center">Call for Papers 2018</h2>
            <p class="intro text-left">
The DEF CON Biohacking Village is a multi-day biotechnology conference focused on breakthrough DIY, grinder, transhumanist, medical technology, and information security along with its related communities in the open source ecosystem. There have been multiple instances of DIYBio overcoming conventional science. We want to celebrate the biohacker movement with a compendium of talks, demonstrations, and a medical device hackathon.<br>
<br>
The 2018 BioHacking Village theme is Medical Industry Disrupt. The Medical Industry is one of the last to be touched by technology. We have placed doctors and the study of medicine on an alter for years; the time of ivory towers, pedestals, and information isolation has come to an end. Biohackers are working on projects that have traditionally been kept in the labs of the medical institutions. We are moving science forward by working on DIY projects that matter and use citizen science to solve the economic problems that are caused by privatizing medicine and the resources for research.<br>
<br>
Our goal is to extend beyond the scope of mission driven technology. This event and the community behind it place a strong emphasis on diversity, inclusiveness, education, collaboration, and contribution. The BioHacking Village is also focused on helping developers learn the skills and other factors associated with successful careers in biotechnology and software development. The event aims to provide opportunities to interact with like-minded scientists and developers, to learn from one another, as well as help each other see opportunities that may be available.<br>
<br>
We welcome anyone interested in do-it-yourself biology. Biohackers reject the idea that all medical, biological, and genetic advancements must come from a large institutions, university, or corporation. We reject the idea that modifications to biology must only be in response to disease or dysfunction. We reject the natural order given to us by evolution… or perhaps we have evolved to the point where we can take evolution into our own hands. We dare to ask the questions: How can we use technology to enhance our raw abilities, specific skills, overall health, or well-being? How can we usher in an age where we not only fix what’s broken, but we make ourselves, and our world, better?

            <h2 class="title">Instruction for Authors</h2>
Like all hackers, we are looking to subvert the dominant paradigm...of life itself. Your talk should excite, elucidate, enlighten, and engage participants in the technical, mechanical, procedural, and human side of biohacking.<br>
<br>
We are seeking three kinds of submissions: talks, demos, and labs.<br>
<br>
<span class="purple_text bold">Talks</span> are the standard non-interactive presentation style, generally with slides, where one or several people enlighten, educate, and inspire the audience on an interesting topic or project.<br>
<br>
<span class="purple_text bold">Demos</span> also stick to the presentation, one-to-many format, but the presenter uses most of the time to display a working technology, in real time, and may involve some level of audience interactivity.<br>
<br>
<span class="purple_text bold">Labs</span> are purely hands on for the participants, who can wander in and DIY their way into biohacking. There is very little instruction, and when there is, it is one-on-one. Examples in other villages include the lock trees in the Lockpicking Village, and the tamper-evident kits in the Tamper Evident Village. Submitters are expected to provide their own materials.<br>
<br>
In your submission, please indicate which you are applying for, but don’t worry too much if you aren’t sure. Take your best guess, and if we like your topic, we can easily change the submission type for you.<br>
<br>
We require: A title, an abstract, outline, and presenter bio(s). If you have additional materials, such as an early draft of your slides or presentation text, please feel free to attach.<br>
<br>
Time slots: Talk times can either be 30 minutes or 60 minutes with a demonstration. Please select your preference on the form. We reserve the right to pick a different time slot for you.<br>
<br>
AV: Please let us know if you have AV or technical requirements besides the standard projector and mic.<br>
<br>
Multiple Submissions: You are allowed to separately submit as many papers as you like.<br>
<br>
Your submission will be held to the following standards:<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li class="green_text">
<span class = "purple_text">
Scientific rigor –
</span>
<span class="white_text">
Was the project conducted in accordance with the scientific method, and were any hypotheses properly investigated? Are less-scientific aspects of the topic acknowledged as such? If you’re not making any scientific claims, does your technology actually work? Or, if it was a failure, is it acknowledged as such with a detailed and interesting description of lessons-learned?
</span>
</li>
<li class="green_text">
<span class = "purple_text">
Significance –
</span>
<span class="white_text">
Is your project significant to the biohacking and scientific community? Does it add value, for either scientific, technological, ethical, cultural, or artistic purposes?
</span>
</li>
<li class="green_text">
<span class = "purple_text">
Originality –
</span>
<span class="white_text">
Is your project an original work, or at least sufficiently different from the work it builds on? (Exceptions can be made, especially for introductory & educational 101 talks.)
</span>
</li>
<li class="green_text">
<span class = "purple_text">
Coolness –
</span>
<span class="white_text">
Extra points will be given for the “cool” factor. We want to be wowed. We want our jaws to drop in wonder. We want to be blown away with the inspiring possibility that you have made reality. Amaze us.
</span>

<li class="green_text">
<span class = "purple_text">
No Spam Zone:
</span>
<span class="white_text">
No sales-focused talks or demos. Product demos or brief mention of products may be appropriate if the audience walks away with a deeper understanding of the actual technology or science involved. The focus needs to be on knowledge and skills, not on promoting a specific for-fee product. Spammers will be immediately rejected!

The BHV celebrates global health ingenuity arising from maker communities from the dynamic perspective of emerging biology, technology, and human-enhancement. In one year, we have more than doubled our talks and tripled the number of attendees. The BioHacking Village has grown from a small half village of 11 talks and demos to a full village with 28 non-stop talks and demonstrations with standing room only and entrance lines that exceeded capacity.<br>
</br>
Whether your interest lies in security, technology, engineering, science, humanities, design, or fabrication, donors to the BioHacking Village can be assured they are reaching an audience of unapologetically enthusiastic innovators.<br>
